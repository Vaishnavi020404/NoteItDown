For My Understanding:

Yes, you’re **mostly correct**, but let me explain carefully and cleanly so you can really understand **why each part exists** and how they work together in a full-stack app.

---

### 1️⃣ Client (Front-end)

* This is the part **the user interacts with** (browser, React app, mobile app, etc.).
* It **doesn’t talk directly to the database**.
* Its job:

  * Take user input
  * Send requests to the server
  * Show the data received from the server

**Example:** A user clicks “Get Notes” → client sends a request to `/api/notes`.

---

### 2️⃣ Server (Back-end)

* The **middleman** between client and database.
* Receives client requests, **processes them**, applies any business logic, then talks to the database if needed.
* Sends back a **response** to the client.

**Example:** Server receives GET `/api/notes` → fetches notes from the database → sends notes back to client.

---

### 3️⃣ Database

* Stores the **actual data**.
* Doesn’t interact directly with the client.
* The server queries the database to **read/write/update/delete data**.

**Example:** Database stores all the notes. Server queries it for all notes when requested.

---

### 4️⃣ API (Application Programming Interface)

* An API is **a set of rules that defines how the client and server talk to each other**.
* It makes communication **organized, consistent, and secure**.
* Without APIs, the client wouldn’t know how to ask for data or how the server expects the request.

**Example:**

* Client sends GET request to `/api/notes`
* Server knows “GET `/api/notes` → return all notes in JSON format”
* Client can then render those notes on the page

---

### ✅ Putting it all together (sequence)

1. **Client** → sends request to `/api/notes`
2. **Server** → receives request → talks to database
3. **Database** → returns data to server
4. **Server** → processes data → sends response to client
5. **Client** → displays data to the user

---

💡 **Analogy:**

* **Client** = person ordering food
* **Server** = waiter who takes the order, goes to the kitchen
* **Database** = kitchen where food is made
* **API** = menu & rules on how to order food

----------------------------------------------
/api/notes is just an address on the server.

Think of it like a house address: the client (browser or app) knows exactly where to go to get or send notes.

/api → tells “this is an API route”

/notes → tells “we are talking about notes data”

So when the client goes to /api/notes, it’s like saying:

“Server, please give me all the notes”
or
“Server, here’s a new note, save it”

✅ That’s all it is — just a path or endpoint the client uses to communicate with the server.


The server is not “at” /api/notes.

The server runs somewhere (like http://localhost:5001) and listens for requests.

/api/notes is just a path on the server that the server knows how to handle.

Analogy:

Server = a restaurant

/api/notes = a specific counter in the restaurant for “notes orders”

Client = you, the customer

You don’t go inside the restaurant yourself; you just go to the counter /api/notes to get your notes. The restaurant (server) decides what to do behind the scenes.

In technical terms:
app.get("/api/notes", (req, res) => {
  // server code runs here
  res.send("you got 5 notes");
});


app.get("/api/notes") = server listens for requests at that path

When a client hits /api/notes, this code runs and sends a response

✅ So the server is running on a host & port (localhost:5001), and /api/notes is just the route on the server.


(prev) => prev.filter(...)
is the same as writing:
function(prev) {
  return prev.filter(...);
}
